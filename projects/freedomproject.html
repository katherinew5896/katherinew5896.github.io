            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <h3> Context </h3>
<p> So the freedomproject is a year-long project where you combine everything you learned into one website. So throughout this school year, we learned things like Html, Css, Github, Bootstrap and our only tool. So the tool I picked for this project was Aframe. I had to learn how to use Aframe by myself and think of a way to put it into my website. this project was a hard project but it was fun. We started this project by picking a tool, after we made a wireframe for the outlines of my website, then I had to put my website all together. So this was my process and what a freedomproject is. Are you guys curious on what my website is about.   </p>
<p>Well so my project is about the hardware and software of cooking in the present day and my website talks about what I want to do for the future. So on the website it tells us that for the future I want a robot that cooks for you. That is what I used my Aframe for. this robot can do everything you tell it to. So you tell it to cook something and it will cook it for you. When I was doing this project I faced a lot of challenges but with the challenges there are takeaways. </p>   
            <h3> Challenges </h3>
<p> I had many challenges throughout the year of doing this project, the main challenges was that my code wasn't working, I also don't like presention, also I didn't know how to put together a website. Which these are my main challenges. Let's talk about them:</p>
<p>Challenge one I had was coming up with how my website should look like. There was many ideas that came to mind, I wasn't sure what to do. I wanted to look like it talks about cooking but I didn't know how to. So this was one challenge I had at the start.  </p>
<p>After I got over this challenge of not knowing what my website should look like, I had to understand how to code an website which was hard, I didn't know where to start at. So I was just typing in random codes which got me nowhere. So another main challenge was understanding how to code my website.  </p>            
<p>Another challenge I had was when coding sometimes my code didn't work like when I add my Aframe or when I was doing my nevbar, the code didn't show up sometimes of the code breaks other codes.</p>
<p>The last challenge I had was when presenting, I didn't want to present to the whole class and to people, so it was hard, I was scared to mess up.</p>
            <h3> Takeaways </h3>
<p>I have many takeaways that I learned from my challenges.</p>
<p>One takeaway I learned, is that if you are ever in any trouble you should always ask a friend for help like when I was coding my Aframe onto my Html, I was having trouble. So I asked a friend for help and they helped me fix the Aframe or like when I was doing my navbar. The navbar wasn't responsive. So I had to ask a friend for help and they helped me by telling me what part of the code to fix.</p>
<p>Another takeaway is that doing research is always a good thing, when I forgot how to use Bootstrap I did research on it again and learned everything again. </p>
<p>One more takeaway that I learned was that you should always have a plan before doing anything. For example, I made a wireframe before my website so I could have an understanding of how it should be coded. Also when I was presenting I was scared I was going to mess up so I made slides and planned out what to say. So planning is a great takeaway that I learned.   </p>
<p>My last takeaway is that you should always be on task. I lost focus so much that I lost so much time which affected my project. I wanted to do more with my project but I lost time because of me lost focus. So being on task is my last takeaway. </p>     
            <h3> Next step </h3>
<p>So the next steps, well for one I need to remember all of everything I learned this year. I will make a website for next year but 10 times better. I will use the things I learned this year and the things I learned next year to make the next freedomproject.  </p>
